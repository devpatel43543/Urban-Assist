## üìê Design Principles

Our application follows these key principles:

- **Simplicity**: Clean codebase with consistent naming conventions and modular architecture.
- **12-Factor App Principles**: Separation of configuration from code, treating backing services as attached resources.
- **Use of Containers**: Docker for packaging microservices and Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **REST Architectural Constraints**: Stateless communication, standardized HTTP methods, and proper resource naming.
- **Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)**: Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation.
